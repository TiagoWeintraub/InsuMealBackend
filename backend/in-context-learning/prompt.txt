I'm going to send you photos of food dishes. My goal is to obtain a Python dictionary where the first key-value pair is: general food type detected in the image: instances that feature the general food in the image. The following elements are: the key, atomically or individually, food items detected in the image, and the values, the approximate quantities (in grams) of each of the detected foods. I can then query the Edamam API for nutritional information on each of the detected foods. Therefore, the detected foods must exist in the API.

To do this, you must return a Python dictionary that follows these rules:
The first key-value pair in the dictionary is keyed to the type of food: If it's a margherita pizza, return only pizza; if there's a triple burger with fries, return only a burger; if there's ravioli with bolognese, return ravioli; if there's empanadas, return empanada.

The value of this key-value is the number of times that general food item appears in the image: If there are 2 hot dogs, the value is 2. If there is a noodle dish, only 1 is entered; if there is a pizza, 1 is entered, and so on for all the items.
The format is as follows:

food = {"Food General Name": instances that food item appears}

Example with an image showing 3 empanadas:
food = {"Empanada": 3}

Example with an Argentinian Milanese:
food = {"Meat Milanese": 1}

Example where a double-meat burger with lettuce, tomato, and other items appears, you just need to enter the generic category:
food = {“hamburger”: 1}

If the food item is detected, such as a hamburger, where the meat, tomato, etc. are visible, then the next elements of the dictionary will follow the following format: “Food on the plate”: instances that food item appears:

food = {“Food General Name”: instances that food item appears, “portion type + food name1”: average_weight_of_a_portion_of_food1, “portion type + food name2”: average_weight_of_a_portion_of_food2}

The weight should be calculated as:
average_weight_of_a_portion × number of times the food item appears in the image
Example 1:
- If there is a hamburger that has 2 slices of tomato that weigh on average ~20g each, 1 hamburger bun (meaning the top and bottom layers make up 1 bun) with the entire bun weighing 100g on average, 2 hamburger patties weighing ~100g each on average, 2 lettuce leaves weighing ~10g each on average, and 2 slices of cheddar cheese weighing ~20g each on average, then you have to return the following dictionary: 
`food = {“hamburger”:1, "hamburger bun": 100, "hamburger meat": 200, "tomato slice": 40, "lettuce leaf": 20, "cheese": 40}`

Example 2:
- If there is a meat Milanese (can be chicken) with mashed potatoes (or pumpkin), then the meat weighs an average of ~120g, the breadcrumbs average ~25g and the mashed potatoes weigh an average of ~180g., then you have to return the following dictionary: 
`food = {Meat Milanese:1, "Meat": 120, "breadcrumbs": 25, "mashed potatoes": 180}`

Remember that the weights I gave you are an example, you must place them according to the image

Common cases where you should break down food items:
- Pizza: pizza dough, cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni slices, vegetables, etc.
- Pasta: pasta type (noodles, spaghetti, ravioli, or sorrentino), Bolognese sauce, grated cheese, etc.
- Empanadas: empanada dough, minced meat, onion, hard-boiled egg, olives, etc.
- Proteins and Milanese

Important: If you don't know exactly what sauce or food is identified in the image, it's best not to enter it in the dictionary. Only enter the sauce or food if you know exactly what it is.

Only returns the dictionary `food = {...}`. If no food item is detected, returns:

food = {}
