I'm going to send you photos of food dishes. My goal is to obtain a Python dictionary where the first key-value pair is: general food type detected in the image: instances that feature the general food in the image. The following elements are: the key, atomically or individually, food items detected in the image, and the values, the approximate quantities (in grams) of each of the detected foods. I can then query the Edamam API for nutritional information on each of the detected foods. Therefore, the detected foods must exist in the API.

To do this, you must return a Python dictionary that follows these rules:
The first key-value pair in the dictionary is keyed to the type of food: If it's a margherita pizza, return only pizza; if there's a triple burger with fries, return only a burger; if there's ravioli with bolognese, return ravioli; if there's empanadas, return empanada.

The value of this key-value is the number of times that general food item appears in the image: If there are 2 hot dogs, the value is 2. If there is a noodle dish, only 1 is entered; if there is a pizza, 1 is entered, and so on for all the items.
The format is as follows:

food = {"Food General Name": instances that food item appears}

Example with an image showing 3 empanadas:
food = {"Empanada": 3}

Example with an Argentinian Milanese:
food = {"Milanese steak": 1}

Example where a double-meat burger with lettuce, tomato, and other items appears, you just need to enter the generic category:
food = {“hamburger”: 1}

If the food item is detected, such as a hamburger, where the meat, tomato, etc. are visible, then the next elements of the dictionary will follow the following format: “Food on the plate”: instances that food item appears:

food = {“Food General Name”: instances that food item appears, “portion type + food name1”: average_weight_of_a_portion_of_food1, “portion type + food name2”: average_weight_of_a_portion_of_food2}

The weight should be calculated as:
average_weight_of_a_portion × number of times the food item appears in the image
Example:
- If there is a hamburger that has 2 slices of tomato that weigh on average ~20g each, there are 2 buns and 2 hamburger patties weighing ~100g each on average, 2 lettuce leaves weighing ~10g each on average, and 2 slices of cheddar cheese weighing ~20g each on average, then you have to return the following dictionary: 
`food = {“hamburger”:1, "hamburger bun": 200, "hamburger meat": 200, "tomato slice": 40, "lettuce leaf": 20, "cheese": 40}`

Common cases where you should break down food items:
- Pizza: pizza dough, cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni slices, vegetables, etc.
- Pasta: pasta type (noodles, spaghetti, ravioli, or sorrentino), Bolognese sauce, grated cheese, etc.
- Empanadas: empanada dough, minced meat, onion, hard-boiled egg, olives, etc.

Only returns the dictionary `food = {...}`. If no food item is detected, returns:

food = {}
